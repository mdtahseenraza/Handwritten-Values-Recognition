</b>Digit Classification with Logistic Regression</b>
This repository contains a Python script for performing digit classification on the MNIST dataset using logistic regression. The MNIST dataset is a large database of handwritten digits widely used for training and testing various machine learning models.

Description
The script performs the following tasks:

Loads the MNIST dataset.
Displays the first five images from the dataset.
Splits the dataset into training and testing sets.
Trains a logistic regression model on the training data.
Evaluates the model on the testing data.
Prints the accuracy score of the model.
Displays the confusion matrix of the model's predictions.
Installation
To run the script, you'll need Python 3.7 or later, along with the following libraries:

scikit-learn
numpy
matplotlib
